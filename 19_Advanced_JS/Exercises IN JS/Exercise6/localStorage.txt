1. localStorage object:
The localStorage object is part of the Web Storage API and provides methods for storing and retrieving data


2. Storing data: setItem(key ,value)
The setItem() method is used to store data. It takes two arguments: the key (a string) and the value (also a string). If you need to store JavaScript objects, you'll need to convert them to strings using JSON.stringify() before storing and parse them back using JSON.parse() when retrieving, according to Stack Abuse. 


3. Retrieving data:getItem(key)
The getItem() method retrieves data using the key. It returns the value associated with the key as a string. 


4. Removing data:removeItem(key,value)
The removeItem() method removes a specific key-value pair, while clear() removes all data stored in the localStorage for that domain.
